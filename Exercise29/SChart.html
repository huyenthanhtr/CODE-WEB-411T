    <h3 style="color: red; text-align: center;">Doc-Centric Sales: South Region
    </h3>
    <p style="color: red; text-align:center;">Sales in the Southern region were off last year as the economy entered a slight downturn. Sales of the M100-10 model suffered the largest decline - 15% under sales two years ago. The lone bright spot was the continuing strong sales of the M300-25 unit which increased as last year progressed.
