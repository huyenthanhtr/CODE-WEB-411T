    <h3 style="color: red; text-align: center;">Doc-Centric Sales: Midwest Region

    </h3>
<p style="color: red; text-align:center;">The Midwest region had another strong sales year with record-setting sales of both the M300-25 and M100-11 models. The only disappointment was the lackluster sales of the M300-15 model, 
which started the year strong but tapered off into the fourth quarter. All-in-all though, a very good year for the Midwest region.
